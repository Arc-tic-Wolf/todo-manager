In serverside folder, run "npm start". This will start backend server.
Goto "http://localhost:5100/todos". This will call the REST API which returns a list of todos in JSON format.
Then in clientside folder, run "npm start". This will start frontend react app on http://localhost:3000. There the UI is showcased with options of creating or updating todos.
I have used a simple json data format to store my list of todos. You can find the file at ./serverside/data.json . However, I rendered the frontend with data using a fetch call from the backend.
This is my required project. Thank you.
